abstract = {The Travelling Salesman and its variations are some of the most well known NP hard optimisation problems. This paper looks to use both centralised and decentralised implementations of Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) to solve a dynamic variant of the Multi-Agent Travelling Salesman Problem (MATSP). The problem is dynamic, requiring an on-line solution, whereby tasks are completed during simulation with new tasks added and completed ones removed. The problem is allocating an active set of tasks to a set of agents whilst simultaneously planning the route for each agent. The allocation and routing are closely coupled parts of the same problem making it difficult to decompose, instead this paper uses multiple populations with well defined interactions to exploit the problem structure. This work attempts to align the real world implementation demands of a decentralised solution, where agents are far apart and have communication limits, to that of the structure of the multi-demic EA solution process, ultimately allowing decentralised parts of the problem to be solved `on board' agents and allow for robust communication and exchange of tasks.},

abstract = {This paper explores a geometric approach to finding optimal routes for commercial formation flight. A weighted extension of the classical Fermat point problem is used to develop an analytic solution to finding optimal routes, thereby reducing the complexity of the problem and enabling a quick evaluation. We then construct a method to decouple origin and destination nodes creating a vertex from which the route projects, along with loci of possible points of formation. This implementation enables us to take lists of routes and efficiently decompose them to find the optimal locations for flights to meet, fly in formation and then break away and continue on their solo paths. We look at a case study of creating formations from 210 transatlantic flights for a fleet size of up to 2, resulting in overall global approximate total fuel savings of 8.6{\%}. Furthermore we explore heuristic methods to finding solutions when creating larger fleet size formations, indicating savings surpassing 10{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.},

@phdthesis{Kent2015a,
abstract = {This thesis investigates the notion of fuel-reduction through formation flight for com- mercial aircraft, addressing the problems of global routing and assignment. A two stage centralised approach is presented, firstly, assuming a reduction in observed cost by flying in formation the routes, including rendezvous and break points, are calcu- lated to minimise a total cost. The interconnected assignment problem then takes a set of flights, their possible formations and corresponding costs and optimally allo- cates them into a cost-minimising formation fleet. An analytic geometric approach is used to develop a scalable methodology for the formation routing problem enabling the quick calculation of costs. The rapid evaluation allows the large scale fleet assignment problem to be solved via a Mixed Integer Linear Program in reasonable time. A Transatlantic case study shows possible formation fuel savings against solo flight of around 8.7{\%} and 13.1{\%} for formations up to size two and three respectively. Further case studies of three distinct sets of flights show that encouraging levels of saving can still be achieved by flights with varied distances, geographical locations and formation drag-reduction levels. For the more complex task of routing through wind, results show that the analytic approach can act as a reasonable estimate to the assignment problem, allowing higher- fidelity and computationally more intensive routing methods to be introduced via a post-process, significantly reducing solve time. Methods for mitigating the impact of uncertainty in aircraft take-off times are ex- plored, where a state-space approach, solved using value iteration, can provide optimal speed-policies for aircraft to follow for any possible realisation of delay. Additionally portfolio optimisation provides a method for formations to be assigned to simultane- ously maximise reward and minimise the associated risk. Finally the calculation of efficient frontiers allows matching of reward to desired levels of risk-aversion.},

abstract = {This paper explores an extension to a geometric approach of finding optimal routes for commercial formation flight. An adaption of the Breguet range equation, alongside specific aircraft characteristics, is used to represent realistic aircraft and underlying changes in weight as fuel is burnt off. Weighting schemes, for both nominal and differential rates of fuel burn, are introduced and compared. Finally a method for finding wind-optimal routes in a formation flight paradigm is developed in order to assess the effectiveness of a geometric estimate for the formation pair assignment problem. Using the geometric method to allocate formation pairs is shown to offer good performance for solutions with a significant reduction in computation time against all possible wind-optimal formation routes.},
