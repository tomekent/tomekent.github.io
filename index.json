Instead we want to utilise the fact that these agents exist in a world that can be compartmentalised. There are real world constraints, such as geographical seperation that can be used to our advantage.\nWe use the population-distribution island-model, where the global population is divided into a number of demes (distinct populations) and referred to as the Multi-Demic Evolutionary Algorithm (MDEA). Communications between these demes allow for individuals to migrate between them at pre-defined intervals. These demes are structured to align with real world execution of a MATSP where tasks are distributed amongst multiple agents and are completed independently.\nMATSP Problem Statement Here we present what\u0026rsquo;s known as thethe three-index flow-based formulation First define the indexes $i$ and $j$ to denote a task from the set T of tasks 1 to N , the set A of agents from 1 to M and the matrix c i ja to denote the cost of agent a travelling from task i to task j. Additionally we define the three-index binary decision variable:\nFirst define the indexes $i$ and $j$ to denote a task from the set $T$ of tasks 1 to $N$, the set $A$ of agents from 1 to $M$ and the matrix $c_{ija}$ to denote the cost of agent $a$ travelling from task $i$ to task $j$. Additionally we define the three-index binary decision variable:\n$$ \\begin{equation*} x_{ija} = \\begin{cases} 1 \u0026amp; \\text{if agent $a$ visits task $j$ immediately after task $i$,}\\\\\\\n0 \u0026amp; \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} \\end{equation*} $$\n$$ \\begin{align} \\min_{x_{ija}} \u0026amp; \\sum_{i = 1}^{N} \\sum_{j = 1}^{N} \\sum_{a = 1}^{M} c_{ija} x_{ija} \\\\\\\n\u0026amp; \\sum_{i = 1}^{N}x_{ipa} - \\sum_{j = 1}^{N}x_{pja} = 0, \\text{ }a \\in A, p \\in T \\label{MATSP_flow} \\\\\\\n\u0026amp; \\sum_{j = 1}^{N}x_{1ja} = 1, \\text{ } \\forall a \\in A \\label{MATSP_one_agent}\\\\\\\n\u0026amp; u_i - u_j + N \\sum_{a = 1}^{M} x_{ija} \\leq N -1, \\text{ } \\forall i \\neq j \\neq 1 \\label{MATSP_subtour}\\\\\\\n\u0026amp; x_{ija} \\in {0,1} \\text{ } \\forall i,j,a \\end{align} $$\nThe objective, is to minimize the total cost of all the agents travelling between the assigned tasks. The next constraints ensure that each task is visited only once while the flow conservation constraints state that once an agent visits a task then they must also depart from it. The \u0026lsquo;one-agent\u0026rsquo; constraints ensure that each agent is used only once and the sub-tour elimination constraints are used, where $u$ are additional non-negative auxiliary decision variables, with $u_i$ corresponding to the ith task, known as \u0026lsquo;node potentials\u0026rsquo;.\nEvolutionary Approach for MATSP 3 main Evolutionary Stages  Initialisation - creating an starting population for which to evolve; Reproduction - carrying out evolutionary operators such as crossover, mutation and improvement heuristics to produce offspring; Selection - taking individuals from both the main population and from the offspring to produce the new population;     Chromosome representation of route structure   Crossover operator to create offspring from combining features of the two parent solutions   SBX Crossover operator   Mutation operators to create slightly different offspring from one parent solutions     Mutation operator - reallocate tasks     Mutation operator - Swap Tasks   Improvement operator to try to quickly improve a solution using 2 opt   Improvement operator - 2 opt swap   Aim: Multi-demic Evolutionary Algorithm  Exploit problem structure, aligning real-world implementation demands Decentralised solution with Communication Use multiple populations (or demes) With well-defined agent-population interactions  Each agent has population structures for \u0026lsquo;thinking about\u0026rsquo; intereactions with other agents. A population \u0026lsquo;A-B\u0026rsquo; that exists onboard agent A is constantly evolved and updated. If new tasks arise these are incorporated, if agent A and agent B come in communiction range then they can \u0026lsquo;pool\u0026rsquo; their A-B and B-A populations and prune any that are now invalid.\n  Population Structures   Results The objective function, total distance travelled, shown in the below figure, clearly shows that as the communications restriction is gradually lifted the total distances of the dMDEA results tends to the cMDEA, notably, any communication radius of 125 or greater either matches or outperforms the EA.\n  Communication range vs Total Distance   In addition, as communication range is increased the agents spend more time evolving the demes corresponding to nearby agents and thus the linear runtime increases. The next figure shows the relationship between the communication radius and thus the number of other agents to consider and the resulting run-time. Therefore there is a clear trade-off decision between ability to communicate, and thus agents you should consider, and run-time.\n  Communication range vs Total Sim time   Demos Decentralised - Homogeneous Comms   Decentralised - Heterogeneous Comms   But I was after a free lunch   Trade-off between optimisation factors   Sadly that\u0026rsquo;s really the issue here, in many optimisation problems, but particularly in heuristic iterative approaches such as EAs, there is a trade off between problem complexity, runtime and quality of solution (Figure 4). If you want to keep your compute time the same, i.e. limit generations and population size, but need to solve a harder problem, i.e. one with more agents, you will need to sacrifice solution quality.\n  Trade-off between optimisation factors   Read the full paper If you want to read in a bit more detail then you can find the full paper here:  Kent 2019  ","date":1581116139,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1581116139,"objectID":"c6836c7bd21463bee0d4a4f9f941fd12","permalink":"https://tomekent.github.io/post/multiagent-travellingsalesmanproblem/","publishdate":"2020-02-07T22:55:39Z","relpermalink":"/post/multiagent-travellingsalesmanproblem/","section":"post","summary":"This is a summary of some work published last year at the 2019 Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference .\nGeneral Problem There are a number of real world problems that require several agents to visit areas of interest, complete tasks and travel between them.

This paper looks to use both centralised and decentralised implementations of Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) to solve a dynamic variant of the Multi-Agent Travelling Salesman Problem (MATSP). The problem is dynamic, requiring an on-line solution, whereby tasks are completed during simulation with new tasks added and completed ones removed. The problem is allocating an active set of tasks to a set of agents whilst simultaneously planning the route for each agent. The allocation and routing are closely coupled parts of the same problem making it difficult to decompose, instead this paper uses multiple populations with well defined interactions to exploit the problem structure. This work attempts to align the real world implementation demands of a decentralised solution, where agents are far apart and have communication limits, to that of the structure of the multi-demic EA solution process, ultimately allowing decentralised parts of the problem to be solved `on board' agents and allow for robust communication and exchange of tasks.","tags":["Allocation and Routing","Decision Making","Distributed problem solving","Evolutionary Algorithms","Multi Agent Travelling Salesman"],"title":"Decentralised Multi-Demic Evolutionary Approach to the Dynamic Multi-Agent Travelling Salesman Problem","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thomas E.

A two stage centralised approach is presented, firstly, assuming a reduction in observed cost by flying in formation the routes, including rendezvous and break points, are calcu- lated to minimise a total cost. The interconnected assignment problem then takes a set of flights, their possible formations and corresponding costs and optimally allo- cates them into a cost-minimising formation fleet. An analytic geometric approach is used to develop a scalable methodology for the formation routing problem enabling the quick calculation of costs. The rapid evaluation allows the large scale fleet assignment problem to be solved via a Mixed Integer Linear Program in reasonable time. A Transatlantic case study shows possible formation fuel savings against solo flight of around 8.7% and 13.1% for formations up to size two and three respectively. Further case studies of three distinct sets of flights show that encouraging levels of saving can still be achieved by flights with varied distances, geographical locations and formation drag-reduction levels. For the more complex task of routing through wind, results show that the analytic approach can act as a reasonable estimate to the assignment problem, allowing higher- fidelity and computationally more intensive routing methods to be introduced via a post-process, significantly reducing solve time. Methods for mitigating the impact of uncertainty in aircraft take-off times are ex- plored, where a state-space approach, solved using value iteration, can provide optimal speed-policies for aircraft to follow for any possible realisation of delay. Additionally portfolio optimisation provides a method for formations to be assigned to simultane- ously maximise reward and minimise the associated risk. Finally the calculation of efficient frontiers allows matching of reward to desired levels of risk-aversion.","tags":null,"title":"Optimal Routing and Assignment for Commercial Formation Flight","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thomas E.

A weighted extension of the classical Fermat point problem is used to develop an analytic solution to finding optimal routes, thereby reducing the complexity of the problem and enabling a quick evaluation. We then construct a method to decouple origin and destination nodes creating a vertex from which the route projects, along with loci of possible points of formation. This implementation enables us to take lists of routes and efficiently decompose them to find the optimal locations for flights to meet, fly in formation and then break away and continue on their solo paths. We look at a case study of creating formations from 210 transatlantic flights for a fleet size of up to 2, resulting in overall global approximate total fuel savings of 8.6%.
